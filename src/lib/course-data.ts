          <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
          <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the structure of web content.</p>
          
          <h3>HTML Elements</h3>
          <p>HTML elements are represented by tags, written using angle brackets. For example, the paragraph tag is written as &lt;p&gt;. Tags usually come in pairs like &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;, where the first tag is the start tag and the second tag is the end tag.</p>
          
          <h3>Basic Structure</h3>
          <p>A basic HTML document structure includes the following elements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; - Defines the document type</li>
            <li>&lt;html&gt; - The root element</li>
            <li>&lt;head&gt; - Contains meta information</li>
            <li>&lt;title&gt; - Specifies a title for the document</li>
            <li>&lt;body&gt; - Contains the visible page content</li>

          <h2>CSS Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.</p>
          
          <h3>CSS Syntax</h3>
          <p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</p>
          
          <h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
          <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style. Here are some common selectors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Element selector (selects elements based on the element name)</li>
            <li>ID selector (selects an element based on its id attribute)</li>
            <li>Class selector (selects elements with a specific class attribute)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>CSS Box Model</h3>
          <p>All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.</p>

          <h3>Why React?</h3>
          <p>React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.</p>
          
          <h3>React Components</h3>
          <p>Components are the building blocks of any React application. A component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs (called "props") and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear.</p>
          
          <h3>JSX</h3>
          <p>JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. JSX gets compiled to React.createElement() calls which return plain JavaScript objects called "React elements".</p>

          <h3>Props</h3>
          <p>Props (short for "properties") are a way of passing data from parent to child components. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.</p>
          
          <h3>State</h3>
          <p>State is a JavaScript object that stores a component's dynamic data and determines the component's behavior. State is managed within the component and can be changed over time.</p>
          
          <h3>State vs Props</h3>
          <p>The key difference between state and props:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Props are passed to the component (similar to function parameters)</li>
            <li>State is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function)</li>

          <h2>React Native Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>React Native is a popular framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to create native apps for both iOS and Android from a single codebase.</p>
          
          <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
          <p>React Native is based on React, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms. Key concepts include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Components: Building blocks of a React Native app</li>
            <li>Props: Pass data to components</li>
            <li>State: Manage component data</li>
            <li>JSX: Syntax extension for JavaScript</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Native Components</h3>
          <p>React Native provides a set of built-in components that map to native UI elements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>View: Container similar to a div</li>
            <li>Text: Display text</li>
            <li>Image: Display images</li>
            <li>ScrollView: Scrollable container</li>
            <li>TextInput: Input field for text</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Styling</h3>
          <p>React Native uses a subset of CSS for styling, with some differences due to the mobile environment. Styles are typically defined using JavaScript objects.</p>

          <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
          <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It's a popular choice for enterprise-level applications, Android development, and more.</p>

          <h3>What is Java?</h3>
          <p>Java is known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>

          <h3>Key Features of Java</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Object-Oriented: Based on the concept of objects.</li>
            <li>Platform Independent: Runs on various operating systems.</li>
            <li>Simple: Relatively easy to learn compared to some other languages.</li>
            <li>Secure: Designed with security in mind.</li>
            <li>Robust: Has strong memory management and error handling.</li>
            <li>Multithreaded: Can perform multiple tasks concurrently.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Setting Up Your Development Environment</h3>
          <p>To start programming in Java, you need a Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).</p>

          <h4>JDK Installation</h4>
          <p>Download and install the latest JDK from Oracle's website or use an open-source alternative like OpenJDK. The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and development tools like the compiler (<code>javac</code>).</p>

          <h4>IDE Installation</h4>
          <p>Popular Java IDEs include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Eclipse</li>
            <li>IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate Edition)</li>
            <li>NetBeans</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Install an IDE of your choice. These provide features like code editing, debugging, and project management.</p>

          <h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
          <p>In Java, variables are used to store data. Each variable has a data type that determines the type of data it can hold and the operations that can be performed on it.</p>

          <h3>Data Types</h3>
          <p>Java has two main categories of data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Primitive Data Types:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><code>byte</code>: 8-bit integer</li>
                <li><code>short</code>: 16-bit integer</li>
                <li><code>int</code>: 32-bit integer</li>
                <li><code>long</code>: 64-bit integer</li>
                <li><code>float</code>: 32-bit floating-point</li>
                <li><code>double</code>: 64-bit floating-point</li>
                <li><code>boolean</code>: true or false</li>
                <li><code>char</code>: 16-bit Unicode character</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><code>String</code>: Represents sequences of characters</li>
                <li>Arrays: Collections of elements of the same type</li>
                <li>Classes, Interfaces, etc.: User-defined types</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Declaring and Initializing Variables</h3>
          <p>To declare a variable, you specify its data type followed by the variable name:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">int age;</code></pre>
          <p>You can initialize a variable when you declare it:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">int age = 30;</code></pre>

          <h3>Operators</h3>
          <p>Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Some common operators include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Arithmetic Operators:</strong> <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code></li>
            <li><strong>Assignment Operators:</strong> <code>=</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison Operators:</strong> <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>></code>, <code><</code>, <code>>=</code>, <code><=</code></li>
            <li><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> <code>&&</code> (AND), <code>||</code> (OR), <code>!</code> (NOT)</li>
            <li><strong>Increment/Decrement Operators:</strong> <code>++</code>, <code>--</code></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Control Flow</h2>
          <p>Control flow statements in Java determine the order in which instructions are executed. They allow you to make decisions and repeat blocks of code.</p>

          <h3>Conditional Statements</h3>
          <p>Conditional statements execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met.</p>

          <h4><code>if</code> statement</h4>
          <p>Executes a block of code if a condition is true.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
}</code></pre>

          <h4><code>if-else</code> statement</h4>
          <p>Executes one block if the condition is true and another if it's false.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}</code></pre>

          <h4><code>if-else if-else</code> statement</h4>
          <p>Allows for multiple conditions to be checked.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">if (condition1) {
    // code for condition1
} else if (condition2) {
    // code for condition2
} else {
    // code if none of the above conditions are met
}</code></pre>

          <h4><code>switch</code> statement</h4>
          <p>Provides an alternative to multiple <code>if-else if</code> statements when checking a single variable against multiple values.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code for value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code for value2
        break;
    default:
        // code if no case matches
}</code></pre>

          <h3>Loops</h3>
          <p>Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly.</p>

          <h4><code>for</code> loop</h4>
          <p>Used when you know the number of iterations beforehand.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to repeat
}</code></pre>

          <h4><code>while</code> loop</h4>
          <p>Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">while (condition) {
    // code to repeat
}</code></pre>

          <h4><code>do-while</code> loop</h4>
          <p>Similar to a <code>while</code> loop, but the code block is executed at least once before the condition is checked.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">do {
    // code to repeat
} while (condition);</code></pre>

          <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
          <p>Java is a strongly object-oriented language. OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</p>

          <h3>Key OOP Concepts</h3>

          <h4>1. Classes and Objects</h4>
          <p>A <strong>Class</strong> is a blueprint or template for creating objects. An <strong>Object</strong> is an instance of a class.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">// Class definition
class Car {
    // Attributes
    String model;
    int year;

    // Method
    void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine starting...");
    }
}

// Creating an object
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.model = "Sedan";
myCar.year = 2023;
myCar.startEngine();</code></pre>

          <h4>2. Encapsulation</h4>
          <p>Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also restricts direct access to some components of an object, which can be controlled by access specifiers (<code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>).</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">class Person {
    private String name; // private attribute

    // Public getter method
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Public setter method
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}</code></pre>

          <h4>3. Inheritance</h4>
          <p>A mechanism where one class (subclass or derived class) inherits the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal { // Dog inherits from Animal
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}</code></pre>

          <h4>4. Polymorphism</h4>
          <p>The ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows you to perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism in Java is achieved through method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and method overriding (same method name and parameters in superclass and subclass).</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">class Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override // Method overriding
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}</code></pre>

          <h4>5. Abstraction</h4>
          <p>Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">// Abstract class
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void engine(); // Abstract method

    void honk() {
        System.out.println("Beep beep!");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void engine() {
        System.out.println("Car engine starts.");
    }
}</code></pre>

          <h2>Arrays and Collections</h2>
          <p>Arrays and Collections are used to store and manipulate groups of related data in Java.</p>

          <h3>Arrays</h3>
          <p>An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">// Declaring an array of integers
int[] numbers;

// Initializing an array with a fixed size
numbers = new int[5];

// Declaring and initializing with values
String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};

// Accessing array elements (using index)
String firstPerson = names[0]; // "Alice"

// Modifying array elements
numbers[0] = 10;</code></pre>

          <h3>Java Collections Framework</h3>
          <p>The Java Collections Framework provides a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, allowing them to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. It includes interfaces and classes for various collection types.</p>

          <h4>Key Interfaces</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Collection</code>: The root interface of the collection hierarchy.</li>
            <li><code>List</code>: Ordered collection (sequence). Allows duplicate elements. (e.g., <code>ArrayList</code>, <code>LinkedList</code>)</li>
            <li><code>Set</code>: Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. (e.g., <code>HashSet</code>, <code>TreeSet</code>)</li>
            <li><code>Map</code>: Object that maps keys to values. Keys are unique. (e.g., <code>HashMap</code>, <code>TreeMap</code>)</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Commonly Used Classes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><code>ArrayList</code>: Resizable array implementation of the List interface.</li>
            <li><code>LinkedList</code>: Doubly-linked list implementation of the List interface.</li>
            <li><code>HashSet</code>: Hash table implementation of the Set interface.</li>
            <li><code>HashMap</code>: Hash table implementation of the Map interface.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Working with Collections</h3>
          <pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CollectionsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an ArrayList
        List&lt;String&gt; fruits = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

        // Adding elements
        fruits.add("Apple");
        fruits.add("Banana");
        fruits.add("Orange");

        // Accessing elements
        String firstFruit = fruits.get(0); // "Apple"

        // Iterating through a list
        for (String fruit : fruits) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
